This project is for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/index-cn) [Transfer Tree Shuttle Box](https://ant.design/components/transfer-cn#transfer-demo-tree-) component. transfer) component to demonstrate the implementation of the `right and left side tree shuttle box` component to solve the pain point of the right side `only list` view.
Both left and right sides are tree-structured shuttle boxes, making it easy to select and transfer nodes between the two tree structures, which is especially suitable for scenarios that require interactions in datasets with hierarchical relationships.
## Features
- **Dual Tree View**: Innovatively, the right side of the shuttle box also adopts a tree structure, making it easy to intuitively manage and transfer nested data.
- **Fully customizable**: In addition to the `Tree`, it is still possible to customize other requirements components.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Following the specification type defined by `Antd`, rich property configuration is provided to easily control component behavior and style.
- **Responsive design**: Optimizes the mobile experience and ensures seamless use across devices.
